# chatbot101
Since I decided to change my career, I've been studying a lot of conversational design. This is my first-ever project: the most basic chatbot you can think of. 
My intention was to start my journey by practicing the basics and applying the Python I've studied in the past months. :)

🤖 Simple Chatbot Project

A beginner-friendly chatbot built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. This chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined responses.

📌 Features

Rule-based chatbot with predefined responses

Interactive command-line conversation

Randomized responses for a more natural feel

🛠️ Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/barbaramr7/chatbot101.git
cd chatbot101

2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If only built-in Python libraries are used, you can skip this step.)

4️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook

Open chatbot.ipynb

Run the cells to start interacting with the chatbot!

✨ Example Conversation

Chatbot: Hello! Type 'bye' to exit.
You: Hello
Chatbot: Hi there!
You: How are you?
Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but I'm doing fine!
You: Bye
Chatbot: Goodbye!

📌 Future Improvements

Add more diverse responses

Implement NLP-based responses using spaCy or GPT

Deploy the chatbot on Telegram or as a web-based bot
